# An-Educational-Interactive-Management-System-App
The project is aimed to automate the graduation project and theoretical assignments management systems in different platforms, Such systems meet  the specific requirements needed by the Educational Organization. The developed project concerns with  solving the problem occurs during the manual management of the educational  process. The first problem is for graduate students facing a problem of  fully understanding the specific requirements of applying for a graduation  project proposal and we solved that by giving the students  a full tutorial/reference, so the student can have a detailed tutorial of what the graduation project proposal should be like, and on top of that,  the automated graduation form is designed to ease the process  of registering a project with nearly no mistakes by the student.  For faculty, the graduation project should be presented in a way  that shows details of every aspect. So, it is easy to comprehend and  there is a need for change in aspects of idea, communication with students,  and supervisors. This leads to make easier flow of the project registration  and perform it in a simple and more efficient way. The assignment  management problem, an online assignment system is developed to solve  a problem of stacking papers and organizing assignments in case there  is a need for reviewing an assignment again, a makes it easier for  the student to turn in an assignment online, and for the faculty member  to have the assignments organized, it more efficient for him to create  a question bank and retrieve questions from it to assignments when needed
